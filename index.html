      <p>
        My name is Chidinma Oparah. I am a Nigerian from Imo State. I have a BSc
        and MSc in Economics from the University of Lagos. I am a chartered
        accountant with over four years experience as an Auditor. I am
        married with a son. I enjoy cooking and exploring new things (places,
        cuisines etc) with my partner ðŸ˜‰. I am now on a quest to become a
        skilled frontend engineer.

      <h2><u>Why Frontend Engineering? </u></h2>
      <p>
        I've spent the last four years as an auditor, and I've really enjoyed
        the challenges of analyzing data and finding solutions. Now, I'm looking
        to bring those skills to a new field: frontend engineering. I love the
        idea of taking complex data and turning it into something beautiful and
        easy to use. I think my ability to spot problems and find solutions will
        be a real asset in building great web applications.

      <h2><u>My Goals</u></h2>
      <p>
        <b>My short-term goal</b> is to master the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS),
        move on to learn a frontend framework (ReactJS, Vue) and build a
        portfolio to showcase my skills by third quarter 2025.<br />
        <b>My medium-term goal</b> is to get a junior frontend role by first
        quarter 2026 to gain hands-on experience while I continue to learn more
        advanced frontend concepts.<br />
        <b>My long-term goal</b> is to become a skilled senior frontend
        developer. I want to lead teams, solve complex problems, and mentor
        other developers to help them grow.
